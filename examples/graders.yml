          Judge the similarity between the two sentences without considering formatting, spelling,
          or how the information is presented. Rate the similarity on a scale from 0 to 1.0,
          where 0 means the sentences do not contain the same information, 0.5 means they contain
          overlapping information, and 1.0 means the sentences contain the same information.
          Output only the score.
